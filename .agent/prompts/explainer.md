# Explainer Pattern

## Usage
Use this for documentation or onboarding. It forces the AI to trace data flow rather than just summarizing, helping uncover hidden assumptions.

## Prompt Template

```
Explain the following code step-by-step, tracing data flow and summarizing algorithm logic. Provide annotated comments for each step.
```

## Example

```
Explain the following code step-by-step:
1. Trace data flow from input to output
2. Summarize algorithm logic
3. Provide annotated comments for each step
4. Highlight any hidden assumptions or edge cases
